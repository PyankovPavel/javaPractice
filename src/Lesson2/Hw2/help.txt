merge(A, B):
  C = empty list

  While A and B are not empty:
    If the first element of A is smaller than the first element of B:
      Remove first element of A.
      Add it to the end of C.
    Otherwise:
      Remove first element of B.
      Add it to the end of C.

  If A or B still contains elements, add them to the end of C.

mergeSort(A):
  if length of A is 1:
    return A

  Split A into two lists, L and R.

  Q = merge(mergeSort(L), mergeSort(R))

  return Q
